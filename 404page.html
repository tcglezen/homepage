   <h1> Error 404 Page not found</h1>
   
   <pre> 
	   Hello, it looks like you have reached 
	   a page that does not exist. It is unknown 
	   if you got here due to my horrible 
	   programming skills or because you decided 
	   to enter in random things in the URL. 
	   
	   Either way, this page does not exist. 
	   Please go back to the home page by clicking 
	   the link below. 
	</pre>
	
	
	<a href = "http://www.tcglezen.com"
	title = "Click me already!"
	target = "_self">Click me to go back to home page</a>
	
	<br><br>
   
    <p> 
	    Alternatively, you may click a different link 
	    if you have nothing better to do.
