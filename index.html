		AHHHHHHHH what goes in the intro? <br> 
		Congrats to everybody who is here reading <br> 
		this horribly designed website. Partially <br> 
		because I am too lazy to actually design my<br> 
		website and make it look half decent. <br> 
		<br> 
		
		This is why you guys are here! <br> 
		
		There isn't a "enter in your recommendations" <br> 
		section, but that is to-be-implemented. <br>

	  <pre> 
        I am interested in both statistics and computer science, 
        but in particular, I enjoy the application of the two 
        of them combined: data science. As a result, I am intending
        to major it data science at Berkeley! 
			
        If you would like to see the list of classes that I have taken, 
        feel free to refer to my resume above.
